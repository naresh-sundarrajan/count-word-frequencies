# Count word frequencies

## The Problem

Create a command-line app to count how many times each words appears in a text file.  Specifics:

- Read from `sampleFile.txt,` write to `output.txt`.
- Pretty-print the results.
- Lower-case all words.
- Sort results by frequency.

## The Challenge

Make it run as quickly as possible.

## Current Standings

Shockingly, the python implementation is currently the fastest.  By *a lot*.
